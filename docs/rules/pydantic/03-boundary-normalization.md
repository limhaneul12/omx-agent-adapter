# Boundary and Normalization Rules

## Goal

Keep raw OMX payloads from spreading unchecked through the adapter.

## Boundary Categories

### 1. Agent input boundary
These are requests entering the adapter from callers.

### 2. OMX output boundary
These are payloads coming from OMX, including JSON, JSONL event lines, and normalized command outputs.

### 3. Adapter public output boundary
These are structured results returned to callers.

### 4. Settings/config boundary
These are validated settings inputs when configuration needs a schema.

## Early Normalization Rule

Raw OMX output should be converted into stable adapter contracts early, but not prematurely.

Preferred flow:
1. receive raw OMX output
2. parse the transport unit minimally
3. route or normalize based on event/source shape
4. validate the canonical contract boundary with Pydantic
5. pass structured values onward

Do not keep raw dictionaries moving through multiple layers when a stable schema can be defined.
Do not force every inbound payload into a canonical schema before transport parsing and routing are complete.

## Schema Placement Rule

Keep schemas under `schemas/`.

Split them by concept using:
- `{concept}_schemas.py`

Examples:
- `execution_schemas.py`
- `runtime_schemas.py`
- `teamwork_schemas.py`
- `history_schemas.py`
- `bridge_schemas.py`

## Dynamic Boundary Rule

Some OMX surfaces may remain dynamic in practice.

When that happens:
- keep the dynamic handling localized,
- add a short justification comment if necessary,
- allow a raw passthrough lane when transport parsing succeeded but canonical schema promotion is not yet justified,
- convert to an explicit schema as soon as the stable structure is understood,
- do not let dynamic looseness leak into the stable adapter API.
